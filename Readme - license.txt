HOW TO PLAY AND RULES :
After the initial roll you can reroll three times, each time one die of your choice by pressing the corresponding keys on your keyboard,
if you don't want to reroll press another key.
The hands are as follow: five of a kind > four of a kind > full house > six high straight > five high straight > three of a kind > two pairs > nothing.
Though the values don't matter (for the time being), a pair of fives against a pair of twos will result in a draw.
